# Loan Approval Prediction



# Overview

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not using a deep learning model. The model is trained on historical loan application data to make predictions based on various features such as annual income, loan amount, credit score, and more.


# Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. If you want to deploy the project, additional steps may be required.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python installed on your local machine.
pip package manager installed.

# Installation
- Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/The-DigitalAcademy/PANDAS_LOAN_APPROVAL_PREDICTION_DEEP_LEARNING.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd loan-approval-prediction
- Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt


# Running the Streamlit App

To run the Streamlit app for making loan approval predictions, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the trained model and scaler saved in the project directory.

- Run the Streamlit app using the following code:
streamlit run main.py

- This will start the Streamlit app, and you can access it in your web browser.
