# Loan Approval Prediction Project README

# Overview
**This project focuses on predicting loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to automate the loan approval process, making it more efficient and accurate, while reducing human bias. The dataset contains various features related to loan applicants and their loan approval status.**

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

**loan_id**: Unique identifier for each loan application.

**no_of_dependents**: Number of dependents of the applicant.

**education**: Education level of the applicant.

**self_employed**: Whether the applicant is self-employed or not.

**income_annum**: Annual income of the applicant.

**loan_amount**: Amount of loan requested by the applicant.

**loan_term**: Term of the loan (in months).

**cibil_score**: Credit score of the applicant.

**residential_assets_value**: Value of residential assets owned by the applicant.

**commercial_assets_value**: Value of commercial assets owned by the applicant.

**luxury_assets_value**: Value of luxury assets owned by the applicant.

**bank_asset_value**: Value of assets held in the bank by the applicant.

**loan_status**: Loan approval status (target variable).

## Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

## bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd loan-approval-prediction
Install Dependencies:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preprocessing:

## Place the raw dataset (loan_data.csv) in the data/ directory.
Run the data preprocessing script:
bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Model Training:

## Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data:
bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
Making Predictions:

## Use the trained model to make loan approval predictions:
bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py

Usage
The trained model can be integrated into a web application, API, or any other system where loan approval predictions are required.
Modify the predict.py script to handle input data and return prediction results as needed by the application.
Notes
Ensure that the dataset is updated regularly to maintain the model's accuracy and relevance.
Monitor the model's performance and retrain it with new data if necessary.
