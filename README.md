# Loan Approval Prediction Project README

# Overview
**This project focuses on predicting loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to automate the loan approval process, making it more efficient and accurate, while reducing human bias. The dataset contains various features related to loan applicants and their loan approval status.**

Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

**loan_id**: Unique identifier for each loan application.

**no_of_dependents**: Number of dependents of the applicant.

**education**: Education level of the applicant.

**income_annum**: Annual income of the applicant.

**loan_amount**: Amount of loan requested by the applicant.

**loan_term**: Term of the loan (in months).

**cibil_score**: Credit score of the applicant.

**residential_assets_value**: Value of residential assets owned by the applicant.

**commercial_assets_value**: Value of commercial assets owned by the applicant.

**luxury_assets_value**: Value of luxury assets owned by the applicant.

**bank_asset_value**: Value of assets held in the bank by the applicant.

**loan_status**: Loan approval status (target variable).
